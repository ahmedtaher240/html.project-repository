        <h1><b>What is Machine Learning?</b></h1>
        <p>Machine learning is a specific branch of AI. Its concept is founded on the ability of machines to learn by themselves, instead of humans teaching computers everything they need to know.</p>
        <p>This allows machines to imitate and adapt human-like behaviour. Daily examples of machine learning applications are Facebook’s and mobile facial recognition, product recommendations by Amazon and Google maps indicating the fastest route.</p>
        <p>Cassie Kozyrkov (Chief Decision Intelligence Engineer, Google) explains machine learning by referring to recognising the image of a cat</p>
        <p>In traditional programming, someone would think about all kinds of pixels, labels and other indicators to develop the best possible model (a set of instructions). </p>
        <p>Machine learning uses a ‘completely different programming paradigm’: it just gives examples of cat images and not-cat images and lets the computer find the patterns itself.</p>
        <p>Machine learning is widely recognised as a concept that offers solutions for numerous problems, across a lot of sectors like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>security (data and personal)</li>
            <li>financial services</li>
            <li>healthcare</li>
            <li>manufacturing</li>
            <li>marketing</li>
            <li>transportation (automotive industry)</li>
        </ul>
