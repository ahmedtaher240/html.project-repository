        <p>Most of the existing techniques for page classification on the World Wide Web are based on text only analysis. Recently, several hypertext clustering algorithms have been proposed.</p>
        <p> These provide promising results when the clustering is based on combined term-similarity and hyperlink-similarity measures.</p>
        <p>However, both the traditional and the advanced techniques require improvements in the term- or word-vector representation of Web pages, especially when applied to Web collections dealing with one or a few particular topics.</p>
        <p> In this work we introduce an autonomous agent for hypertext classification which is implemented in Java. This paper describes the development related to text-only analysis, including a modification of a well known rule for information retrieval, and the utilization of word correlation. </p>
        <p> The algorithm has been employed in clustering Web pages related to the subject of neural networks. The results are useful in arriving at an efficient term-vector representation, in order to achieve a rapid and appropriate clustering based on content of on-line documents. </p>
        <p>. The term vectors derived using this algorithm have been classified using a modified adaptive resonance theory (ART) algorithm, an unsupervised learning method in artificial neural networks which is proven to provide very accurate and sophisticated clustering.</p>
