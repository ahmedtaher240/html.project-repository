        <h2> what is Artificial intelligence </h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the ability of machines to carry out ‘smart tasks.</p>
        <p> It is any intelligence demonstrated by a machine, creating optimal solutions to problems.</p>
        <p>These optimal solutions are usually pre-programmed. However, rather than following a single repetitive motion, AI can adapt to different situations.</p>
        <p><a href="https://Microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> refers to AI as a machine’s ability to perform cognitive functions, which are normally associated with humans, and can include learning, reasoning, problem solving and sometimes also human behaviour, such as creativity.</p>
        <p><b>There are three types of AI</b></p>
        <ol>
            <li>narrow AI</li>
            <li>general AI</li>
            <li>super AI</li>
        </ol>
        <h2><b>Narrow AI</b></h2>
        <p>Narrow AI is good at performing single and specific tasks.</p>
        <p> Examples are computer chess, speech and image recognition, as well as Google translate. It also includes weather forecasts, sales predictions and purchase suggestions.</p>
        <p>This is the only real form of artificial intelligence that has been achieved so far.</p>
        <h2><b>General AI</b></h2>
        <p>General AI is when a machine can perform a range of intellectual tasks like a human being.</p>
        <p>It is considered the type of AI that can understand and reason its environment. </p>
        <p>Despite popular opinion, this form of AI is still hard to achieve. It requires a computer or robot to think abstractly.</p>
        <h2><b>Super AI</b></h2>
        <p>Super AI will be achieved when AI out-smarts the human mind in every field, including general wisdom, creativity and social skills.   </p>
